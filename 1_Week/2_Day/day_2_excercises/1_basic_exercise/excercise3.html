    <h2>Lyrics for Lemon tree by Fool's Garden</h2>
    <div>
        <span>Verse 1</span>
        <pre>
        I'm sittin' here in the boring room
        It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
        I'm wastin' my time, I got nothin' to do
        I'm hangin' around, I'm waitin' for you
        But nothing ever happens
        And I wonder      
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span>Verse 2</span>
        <pre>
        I'm drivin' around in my car
        I'm drivin' too fast, I'm drivin' too far
        I'd like to change my point of view
        I feel so lonely, I'm waitin' for you
        But nothing ever happens
        And I wonder
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span>Chorus</span>
        <pre>
        I wonder how, I wonder why
        Yesterday, you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
        And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
        I'm turnin' my head up and down
        I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
        And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span>Post-Chorus</span>
        <pre>
        Sing
        Dap, da-da-da-dam, di-dap-da
        Da-da-da-dam, di-dap-da
        Dap, di-di-li-da
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span>Verse 3</span>
        <pre>
        I'm sittin' here, I missed the power
        I'd like to go out, takin' a shower
        But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
        I feel so tired, put myself into bed
        Well, nothing ever happens
        And I wonder
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span>Bridge</span>
        <pre>
        Isolation is not good for me
        Isolation, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span>Verse 4</span>
        <pre>
        I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
        Maybe, anyhow, I'll get another toy
        And everything will happen
        And you wonder
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span>Chorus</span>
        <pre> 
        I wonder how, I wonder why
        Yesterday, you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
        And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
        I'm turnin' my head up and down
        I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
        And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
        And I wonder, wonder, I wonder how, I wonder why
        Yesterday, you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
        And all that I can see (Ah, dip-dip-dip-dip)
        And all that I can see (Ah, dip-dip-dip-dip)
        And all that I can see
        Is just a yellow lemon tree
