            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                In this animated feature by noted Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, 10-year-old Chihiro (Rumi Hiiragi)
                and her parents (Takashi Nait√¥, Yasuko Sawaguchi) stumble upon a seemingly abandoned amusement park.
                After her mother and father are turned into giant pigs, Chihiro meets the mysterious Haku (Miyu Irino),
                who explains that the park is a resort for supernatural beings who need a break from their time spent in
                the earthly realm, and that she must work there to free herself and her parents.
